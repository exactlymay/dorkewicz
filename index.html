            Dork! I'll never forget those days hanging out with you when you came to visit. Some of the times I've ever laughed the most in my life. Those adventures will be stored in my head and heart forever. Thanks for being such a great caring friend. Appreciate those times youd be looking out for me and just making sure I'm doing okay. Also all the shreds and licks you pull off on the guitar. Amazing! Most caring person I've ever met. Not just towards me. But everyone that surrounds you. Always giving off that positive energy and support to do better. Hope you like the tickets to mamma Mia I got you for your bday. Stay well my friend !

Meeting you on twitch has been one of the greatest things to happen in the final hours of 2019. Not only are you an incredible person, full of love and kindness, you also attract similarly incredible people to you. You were the gateway that brought me to so many amazing people i've been blessed with the opportunity to get to know. For that, I thank you. There are no words to describe the admiration I have for you as a person. I hope the break you have been on has been allowing you to recharge and reignite that wondrous flame you carry. Once again, happy birthday my friend. Much love!

            Things have been too hectic for me to come up with something clever so let me just say that even though you're a colossal loser, you're also one of the most genuine and funny people I've met through Twitch.

            Happy Birthday and I love you...

            Dork. I not only want to wish you a very Happy Birthday. But I want to wish you the continued best in anything and everything that you set out for. You're seriously one of the best people I've gotten to know. And I love you so much both as a friend, and as a great example of the most authentic and beautiful source of friendship that one could ask for. Meeting you was a dream come true. And it was undoubtedly one of my top highlights for TC 2019. I know you've been off Twitch for some time, and that is absolutely all great because you're taking time for you. And doing life things, which is always the upmost of importance. Self care and handling things in the ways that work best for oneself. 
            <br>
            I do hope that life itself has still been extremely awesome. Because I mean it with all of my heart when I say that you deserve to be happy. You deserve to feel well, especially when all you do is spread those feelings and vibes around to every single person that comes into contact with you. So with that being said, Happy Flipping Birthday, to the most lovable and aDORKable Dork in my life. Bless your heart, soul, family and all those who you cherish closely. Thank you for being in my life. And for giving me inspiration, and a full heart. Simply by being yourself <span>&#60;</span>3

            Hey sweet dork :) where to even begin. It feels like yesterday that we just met and you were streaming dead space and screaming a lot. although a lot has changed you still do scream a lot. I know I've told you this so many times but you've completely changed my life, you showed me what true friendship is and what it's like having people that want you to be happy and brought me out of my shell. You gave me the strength when I needed to stand up for myself, the courage to believe in myself, and the love to celebrate myself. That is a gift I could never repay. I'm so proud of everything you have done in your life, from being an excellent entertainer, a phenomenal human, and a good father and son. Now as you make way in your next journey of fitness and mental well being I can honestly say you've inspired me once again to do the same, to not only find that balance but achieve it. You will always be family to me, someone that I would do anything for so please never hesitate to ask. And now to the whole part of this message, Happy birthday you don't look at day over 12, wait? is that how it goes? lmfao but seriously you're an absolute smoke show and it's time you know it. I hope today is filled with so much love, appreciation, and wonderful food and I hope you do realize that I will love you forever. Can't wait to see you again  <span>&#60;</span>3  love, your super annoying friend  <span>&#60;</span>3 but lowkey you're kind of annoying too xoxo

            The first time I met you was through a raid. I followed you soon after, because you had a great energy chat presence. When I followed you, you immediately messaged me and said that I wasn't obligated to catch your stream and that you would pay me NOT to show up. Well I'm glad I didn't listen to you, because I spent a wonderful time in your stream. I was  happy to watch you pause your game, so you could bless us with the most amazing guitar playing. I was so impressed, and it eventually led me back to playing the guitar again. Dork, you are an inspiring person with a heart of gold. Even though I haven't know you for very long, I can tell that you're a very caring and genuine person. I'm happy that Twitch has brought us together. I wish you nothing, but the best. Happy Birthday!  <span>&#60;</span>3
